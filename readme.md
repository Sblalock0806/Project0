My Project will be to create a Library system which will allow users to do the below:
Basic requirements:
 -- Add books to the list
 -- Search for items in the list by Author, Title, partial title or partial author
 -- View the entire list of the books sorted alphabetically by authors last name
 -- Remove a book
 


Items I would like to do:
 -- Create initial list based off top 100 books pulled from the internet and placed in text file or excel...
 -- Ability to note when a book is 'checked out' include timestamp
 -- Ability to 'check a book back in' making it available
 -- Ability to produce a Status of Available or not Available depending on whether the book is checked out or not
