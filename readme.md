Project Title: Project0

Project Description: This a Java/Maven project which allows the user to track the books they have read. The user will be allowed to 
    do the below items from the Main Class:

        1- Add(A) - Add a book including the book title, Author, Genre, rating, and timestamp of when the book 
                       was entered.

        2- View(V) - View all the books stored in an array list. The view automatically sorts all books by the title.

        3- Search(S) - Search the list of books based on the title, author, genre, or rating. The search will pull 
                        any exact matches or all partial matches.

        4- Import(I) - Ability to import a .csv file that contains book title, Author, Genre, rating. When prompted 
                        the user will input the full filepath to the csv file.

        5- Delete(D) - Ability to remove any books from the list based on the book title.

The associated pom.xml contains the necessary dependencies needed to run this application.
